This repository contains links to references (journal papers and videos) that are useful for learning simulation of probability distributions and variable transformation. The latter shows that you don't need to learn Jacobian and can simulate data well.

## **This is a tool book!!**

This book is for the beginner to learn probability distributions and variable transformation in Probability theory and Statistics by Excel or VBA programs, such as, especially, **the sampling distribution of a specific statistic**.

The level of the book starts from basic undergraduate economics/business management/stats/math/CS and in some cases goes up to the research scope. 

## The height of your life depends on the depth of knowledge you have

Being users, programming languages or softwares are the assistant for more efficient work. For students, the two are helping for learning knowledge easily and deeply and understanding the operating/generating process objectively and definatly.
